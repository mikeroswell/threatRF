# Overview
This repository contains code and data for predicting which unassessed regional
taxa are likely to face conservation threats... using occurrence data,
covariates, and a random forest classifiers.

# General organization

- *code* contains R scripts to download occurrence data and GIS layers, process them, and fit the Radom Forests. 
- *data* contains all the downloaded and manufactured datasets (these are often large) for this project
    - *data/fromR* mainly contains tables generated by the scripts in *code*
    - *data/GIS_downloads* contains raster layers downloaded from various sources
    - the data files for this project are very large. As a result, this repository was created using git lfs, see note below
- *figures* contains .pdf files of maps and graphs generated by scripts in *code*
- *notes* is a place where I am recording code snippets and notes to myself, there is not analysis here

# large files and git lfs
This is the first time I'm using git lfs to handle large files in the repo. I'm
not yet sure how the files tracked by lfs are handled if you clone this repo and
have not installed git lfs. For more information on git lfs, see
[here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
