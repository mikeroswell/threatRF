# Overview
This repository contains code and data for Roswell and Esp√≠ndola "Global 
conservation prioritization approach provides credible results at a regional 
scale", an MS about predicting which unassessed regional taxa are likely to face
conservation threats... using occurrence data, covariates, and a random forest 
classifiers.

# General organization

- *code* contains R scripts to download occurrence data and GIS layers, process 
them, and fit the Random Forests. 
- *data* contains all the downloaded and manufactured datasets (these are often 
large) for this project
    - *data/fromR* mainly contains tables generated by the scripts in *code*
    - *data/GIS_downloads* contains raster layers downloaded from various 
    sources
    - the data files for this project are very large. As a result, this 
    repository was created using `git lfs`, see note below
- *figures* contains .pdf files of maps and graphs generated by scripts in 
*code*
- *notes* is a place where I am recording code snippets and notes to myself, 
there is not analysis here

# large files and git lfs
This is the first time I used `git lfs` to handle large files in the repo. 
The files tracked by lfs are most likely handled dysfunctionally you clone this 
repo and have not installed `git lfs`. For more information on `git lfs`, see
[here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
