Bumblebees are social insects; they live in colonies. Most make their homes in abandoned animal
burrows or in grassy tussocks, and feed on both the nectar and pollen rewards
offered by the flowers of the plants they pollinate. </span>Bumblebees have a special technique in foraging
that makes them exclusive pollinators of certain plants. They engage in “buzz pollination” by which
they sonicate the flowers to vibrate the pollen loose from the anthers.&#160; </span>Tomatoes and related plants (Solanaceae),
blueberries (Ericaceae), and others are pollinated this way.</span>","The population is currently decreasing drastically. Dr R.W. Thorp’s unpublished surveys have revealed that, since 1998, the populations have decreased drastically, and no individuals were found at all in 2004. Surveys of many historic and potential sites within the area inhabited by these bumblebees were repeated annually over nine years. Between nine and seventeen historic sites were visited annually. Some were visited more than once for an average of visits of historic sites per year. In addition, six to nineteen potential sites were visited at least once each year. During the first three years, bees were observed at seven new sites (where this bee had not been recorded before) but as time went on this number decreased. The continued abundance of other bumblebee species suggests that the habitat has not recently become uninhabitable.",Decreasing,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bombus franklini </span>occurs only in the USA.

Gonzalez<em>&#160;et al. </em>(2004) observed that nests are&#160;constructed by cutting pieces of vegetation, but these have not been mound shaped and appeared to be modified from vegetation already covering them. Hines<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;(2007) found nests in more grassy substrates in secondary forest or disturbed areas, where&#160;construction and maintenance involved cutting vegetation on top of or around the nest with the mandibles and moving these pieces using the mandibles or a backwards directed sweeping behaviour of the mid and hind legs (Gonzalez<em> et al.</em> 2004). In <em>Bombus (Fervidobombus) atratus</em>,&#160;if the queen disappears or is removed from her colony, she is succeeded by a mated worker, the false queen, which produce both female and male offspring and maintains colony development until the reproductive phase when new queens are produced (Zucchi 1973, Silva-Matos and Garófalo 1995).

Colonies are annual and only the new, mated queens overwinter. These queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. Nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles, or cavities in dead trees. Initially, the queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Bumblebees collect both nectar and pollen of the plants that they pollinate. In general, bumblebees forage from a diversity of plants, although bumblebee species in a given area can vary greatly in their plant preferences, largely due to differences in tongue length. Bumblebees are well-known to engage in “buzz pollination,” a very effective foraging technique in which they sonicate the flowers to vibrate the pollen loose from the anthers.<br/><br/><em>Bombus fervidus</em>&#160;is a long-tongued, later emerging species (Williams&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). It is found in open farmland and fields, urban parks, and gardens throughout its range and nests mostly on the surface of the ground, among long grass or in deserted mouse nests, but does occasionally nest underground.(Williams&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). This is one of the more aggressive bumblebee species, probably as an adaptation to protect more exposed above-ground nests (Williams&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). &#160;Males congregate outside nest entrances in search of mates (Williams <em>et al. </em>2014). Example food plants include <em>Astragalus</em>, <em>Cirsium</em>, <em>Helianthus</em>, <em>Lonicera</em>, <em>Lythrum</em>, <em>Monarda</em>,&#160;<em>Pedicularis</em>,&#160;<em>Penstemon</em>, <em>Trifolium</em>, and <em>Vicia&#160;</em>(Williams&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014)<em>. </em>&#160;This species is a known host to<em> Bombus insularis</em>; it is probably also host to <em>B. suckleyi </em>(Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>","This species is synonymous with<em>&#160;B. californicus</em>,&#160;based on the lack of differentiation in DNA barcodes between individuals with this colour pattern and those with the&#160;<em>B. fervidus s. str.&#160;</em>colour pattern (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Mexican samples of this species are different from the US/Canada ones both morphologically (colour pattern of&#160;<em>B. f. sonomae</em>)&#160;and genetically (according to a preliminary DNA barcodes analysis), but further sampling is required to clarify their taxonomic status.<br/><br/>A number of published studies have demonstrated abundance and persistence declines in this species. A      regional study of bumblebee community structure in Black Rock Forest, New York      during the summer of 2003 found the current bumblebee community      composition differed when compared to historical records; most notably, this survey of over      1,200 bumblebees failed to find <em>B. affinis, B. pensylvanicus</em> and <em>B.      fervidus</em> despite their being noted as previously common in central New      York (Giles and Ascher 2006). In another regional study in southern Ontario, Colla and Packer (2008) found&#160;<em>B. fervidus</em>&#160;(among others) had significantly and dramatically lower relative abundance in 2004-2006 than was exhibited during surveys at the same sites a few decades earlier (1971-1973). A larger study, considering over 69,000 bumblebee specimens of&#160;21 eastern&#160;North America&#160;species collected from 1865-2010, assessed changes in relative abundance and      occupancy of each species&#160;and ranked their conservation status      throughout their entire United States and Canadian ranges (Colla <em>et al</em>. 2012). While      most of the declining species exhibited declines between the last two time      periods considered in the study, <em>B. fervidus </em>was found to be in      chronic decline from earlier time periods to the present (Colla <em>et al.</em>      2012). Considering museum      collections from the mid-1800s, this species was found to have declined      by 70% in relative abundance since the 1930s (Colla <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>We evaluated this species’ spatial distribution in North America (north of Mexico) over time using a measure of change in the&#160;extent of occurrence (EOO) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield <em>et al</em>. 2014)&#160;(see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material)&#160;. We also assessed changes in the species’ relative abundance (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material), which we consider to be an index of abundance relevant to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012). For all three calculations we divided the database into historical (1805-2001, N=128,572) and current (2002-2012, N=74,682) records. This time frame was chosen to meet the IUCN criteria stipulation that species decline must have been observed over the longer of three generations or 10 years. Average decline for this species was calculated by averaging the change in abundance, persistence, and EOO. This analysis yielded the following results (see Supplementary Material for map of change in EOO over time (Figure 1) and graph of change in relative abundance (Figure 2)):<br/><br/><ul><li>Current range size relative to historic range: 84.06%</li><li>Persistence in current range relative to historic occupancy: 85.84%</li><li>Current relative abundance relative to historic values: 38.04%</li><li>Average decline: 30.69%<br/><br/></li></ul>This analysis suggests this species has suffered long term, steady decline.

The queens have been collected as early as February in Mexico (Vergara pers. comm.).<br/> <br/>Bumble bees, as a whole, are eusocial insects that live in colonies composed of a queen, workers and reproductives (males and new queens). Colonies are annual and only the new, mated queens overwinter. These queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. Nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles, or cavities in dead trees. Initially, the queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Bumble bees collect both nectar and pollen of the plants that they pollinate. In general, bumble bees forage from a diversity of plants, although bumble bee species in a given area can vary greatly in their plant preferences, largely due to differences in tongue length. Bumble bees are well-known to engage in “buzz pollination,” a very effective foraging technique in which they sonicate the flowers to vibrate the pollen loose from the anthers.","We evaluated this species’ spatial distribution over time using a measure of change in the&#160;extent of occurrence (EOO; see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2014).

As such, these bees do not found their own nests, but instead, usurp the colonies and worker forces of other bumble bee species. To do this, a mated female enters the nest of another bumble bee species, kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and forcibly (using pheromones and/or physical attacks) ""enslaves"" the workers of that colony to feed her and her developing young. Since all of the resulting cuckoo bee offspring are reproductive (not workers), they leave the colony to mate, and the mated females seek out other nests to attack. Males of this species patrol circuits in search of mates. Before finding and invading a host colony, females feed directly from flowers. The adult food plants of this species include <em>Aster</em>, <em>Cirsium</em>, <em>Echinacea</em>, <em>Helianthus</em> and <em>Solidago</em> (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Cuckoo bees often attack a broad range of host species, but some specialize in attacking the members of just one species or subgenus. <em>Bombus variabilis </em>(=<em>intrudens</em>) is recorded as breeding as a parasite of colonies of <em>Bombus pensylvanicus</em> (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014): females usurp established colonies and lay eggs which the workers of the host colony then rear to adulthood. Its host species is associated with open fields and grasslands (Colla and Dumesh 2010).<br/><p></p>","<p></p>Several North American studies have found decline in the relative abundance and distribution of this species over time. For example, in a study of 56 sites across Illinois, comparisons between recent (2007) surveys and historic records (beginning in 1900) found that although <em>B. variabilis</em> (=<em>intrudens</em>) historically occurred in all geographic regions of the state, it was completely absent in recent surveys and museum collections (2000-2007) (Grixti <em>et al</em>. 2009). This species was last recorded in Illinois in 1980, and is now considered extirpated from the state (Grixti <em>et al</em>. 2009). A larger study considering over 69,000 bumblebee specimens collected from 1865-2010 from various institutions assessed changes in relative abundance and occupancy of 21 North American species and ranked their conservation status throughout their entire U.S. and Canadian ranges (Colla <em>et al</em>. 2012). Although this study considered a larger scale than previous studies, the species found to be declining range-wide were generally consistent with those found to be declining in regional studies. Of all North American bumblebees examined, <em>B. variabilis</em> (=<em>intrudens</em>) was found to exhibit the most decline, showing severe decline in both persistence and relative abundance. This species completely absent from all samples in the most recent time period (1991–2009), despite 94 historical records (Colla <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>We evaluated this species’ spatial distribution over time across its North American range using a measure of change in the extent of occurrence (EOO) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield <em>et al</em>. 2014).

Our analysis suggests that this species has declined in relative abundance consistently since the 1920s, making it one of the rarest in its range, and possibly extinct (Hatfield <em>et al</em>. 2014) throughout its range north of Mexico. The range size calculation reflects the difference in sampling effort between the historical, and the current sampling period, and recognizes that the lack of recent records may be a artefact of sampling. <br/><br/>*The persistence and relative abundance measures do not reflect the population in Mexico and Central America.

Bumblebees are well-known to engage in “buzz pollination,” a very effective foraging technique in which they sonicate the flowers to vibrate the pollen loose from the anthers.<br/><br/><em>B</em><em>ombus pensylvanicus</em> is found in open farmland and fields throughout its range&#160;(Williams&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), although it was common in urban areas in central Midwest (MO, KS, AR, IL, etc.) during the 1980s and early 1990s (S. Cameron and J. Lozior pers.comms. 2012). It nests mostly on the surface of the ground, among long grass, but occasionally underground (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is one of the more aggressive bumblebee species, probably as an adaptation to protect the more exposed aboveground nests (Williams <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). &#160;Males congregate outside nest entrances in search of mates (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2014). Example food plants include <em>Astragalus</em>, <em>Cirsium</em>,&#160;<em>Cornus</em>, <em>Dalea</em>, <em>Echinacea</em>, <em>Helianthus</em>, <em>Kallstoemia</em>, <em>Liatris</em>, <em>Mentzelia</em>, <em>Silphium</em>, <em>Solanum</em>, <em>Trifolium</em>, and <em>Vicia</em>.&#160;This species is host to <em>Bombus variabilis&#160;</em>(Williams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).</p><br/><p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>Recent DNA barcodes support that <em>Bombus sonorus</em> is conspecific with <em>B. pensylvanicus </em>(Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). A population from the south of Mexico (state of Chiapas) is morphologically and genetically distinct from the rest of North America, and could be a separate undescribed species. Further sampling is needed to clarify the situation.<br/><br/>Historically,&#160;<em>Bombus pensylvanicus&#160;</em>was among the broadest ranging bumblebees in North America (Cameron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). However, numerous studies indicate that this species has recently declined, both locally and regionally,&#160;especially in the northern parts of its range. For example, a study examining changes in bumblebee community composition throughout Illinois found that although <em>B.&#160;</em><em>pensylvanicus </em>comprised&#160;28.1%&#160;of&#160;all bumblebees sampled&#160;between 1900 and 1949, it&#160;represented only 4.4%&#160;of the relative abundance in collections from 1950-2007, including extensive surveys performed at 56 sites across the state in 2007. In addition to abundance declines, this study found<em>&#160;B. pensylvanicus </em>has exhibited significant&#160;range declines in Illinois, and is no longer found in the northern 1/3 of the state (Grixti <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160;In&#160;New York State, Giles and Ascher (2006) failed to find this species in a survey of 1200 bumblebees in the Black Rock Forest, despite evidence it was historically common in the region.&#160;In a study in Guelph, Ontario, a comparison of relative abundances of bumblebees collected from 1971-1973 and from 2004-2006 found&#160;<em>B.&#160;</em><em>pensylvanicus</em>&#160;to be completely absent in surveys from 2004-2006, despite previously having a relative abundance of almost 5% in similar surveys carried out in the same region from 1971-1973&#160;(Colla and Packer 2008).<br/><br/>Looking more broadly, a recent long-term study examining historical changes in&#160;187 species of bees (both <em>Bombus</em> and non-<em>Bombus</em>)&#160;in the northeastern United States&#160;found that&#160;<em>B.&#160;</em><em>pensylvanicus, </em>along with two other&#160;<em>Bombus </em>species, has exhibited statistically significant, rapid, and recent population&#160;collapse&#160;across its northeastern U.S. range (Bartomeus <em>et al</em>. 2013). Similarly, in another study comparing current and historical distributions of eight bumblebee species in the United States using nationwide survey data and museum records, Cameron <em>et al.</em> (2011) found that the relative abundances of&#160;<em>B.&#160;</em><em>pensylvanicus</em>&#160;has sharply declined in recent years, from &gt;45% to ~10%&#160;relative abundance&#160;in the Global East, and from &gt;20%&#160;to &lt;5% in the Northern/Coastal East, in comparison with the co-distributed<em> B. impatiens, B. bimaculatus, B. terricola, </em>and<em> B. affinis </em>(see Figure 2 in Cameron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). In this study, intensive survey efforts of &gt;16,000 bees in 40 states (2007-2009)&#160;failed to find this species across large parts of its historical northern and eastern range, resulting in a 23%&#160;range reduction of this species in the recent time period (Cameron<em> et al.</em> 2011). It remains common in parts of its range, largely in the southern Midwest and the southern U.S., especially Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Alabama, although comparisons of survey data with museum collections of multiple species suggest that its relative abundance has declined in recent years in these regions (Cameron <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;In another comprehensive study of bumblebee decline across both the United States and Canada, Colla <em>et al. </em>(2012) found&#160;<em>B. pensylvanicus</em>&#160;to be one of the most declining species of the 21 species examined, persisting in only 34%&#160;of re-sampled historically occupied 50 x 50 km grid cells throughout its United States and Canada range (Colla&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;This study highlights&#160;<em>B. pensylvanicus</em>&#160;as one of the most sharply declining species in North America (Colla <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>We evaluated this species’ spatial distribution over time in North America (north of Mexico) using a measure of change in the&#160;extent of occurrence (EOO) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield <em>et al</em>. 2014) (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material). We also assessed changes in the species’ relative abundance (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material), which we consider to be an index of abundance relevant to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012). For all three calculations we divided the database into historical (1805-2001, N=128,572) and current (2002-2012, N=74,682) records. This timeframe was chosen to meet the IUCN criteria stipulation that species decline must have been observed over the longer of three generations or 10 years. Average decline for this species was calculated by averaging the change in abundance, persistence, and EOO. This analysis yielded the following results (see Supplementary Material for map of change in EOO over time (Figure 1) and graph of change in relative abundance (Figure 2)):<br/><br/></p><p></p><ul><li>Current range size relative to historic range: 81.18%</li><li>Persistence in current range relative to historic occupancy: 53.24%</li><li>Current relative abundance relative to historic values: 11.44%</li><li>Average decline: 51.38%&#160;</li></ul><p></p><p>          </p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></p><br/>The analysis indicates a decline in both distribution and relative abundance in North America, north of Mexico.

These queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. Nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles, or cavities in dead trees. Initially, the queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Bumble bees collect both nectar and pollen of the plants that they pollinate. In general, bumble bees forage from a diversity of plants, although bumble bee species in a given area can vary greatly in their plant preferences, largely due to differences in tongue length.

In addition,&#160;Hines&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2007) pointed out that all observed&#160;nests were cryptic and hard to distinguish from the surrounding ground litter and live vegetation.</span></p><span style="""">Nest architecture of this species also appears to be modified for life in tropical lowland forests. Bumble bees usually establish nests in pre-existing cavities, either underground or beneath dead vegetation. Workers cut and gather leaf litter, which they fashion into conical surface nests. They cut vegetation with their mandibles and move it toward the nest by sweeping it backward under the legs in groups of several bees doing, sometimes in tandem, what forces the cut vegetation onto the mound, where it is incorporated into the thatched nest cover. This action results in the clearing of vegetation in the vicinity of the nest and provides the bees with a dense, waterproof canopy (Cameron and Whitfield 1996,&#160;Cameron<em> et al.</em> 1999, Taylor and Cameron 2003). The nest canopy also acts as a first-line impediment to attack by predatory raids of army ants (Eciton) as they scour the forest floor in search of small prey (Ramírez and Cameron 2003).</span>  <p><span style="""">The nests have been more commonly observed in leaf litter substrates of primary rainforest. In several&#160;nests (Cameron<em> et al.</em> 1999, Taylor and Cameron 2003), construction and maintenance involved cutting vegetation on top of or around the nest with the mandibles and moving these pieces using the mandibles or a backwards directed sweeping behaviour of the mid and hind legs.</span></p><p><em>B. transversalis&#160;</em>colony development in the Amazon Basin is synchronized with the seasonal wet/dry cycles: colonies are established during the wet season and complete their reproductive cycle during the dry season.

As such, these bees do not found their own nests, but instead, usurp the colonies and worker forces of other bumble bee species. To do this, a mated female enters the nest of another bumble bee species, kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and forcibly (using pheromones and/or physical attacks) ""enslaves"" the workers of that colony to feed her and her developing young. Since all of the resulting cuckoo bee offspring are reproductive (not workers), they leave the colony to mate, and then they hibernate. &#160;The next year, after emerging from hibernation, the mated females seek out other nests to attack. &#160;Males of this species patrol circuits in search of mates. Before finding and invading a host colony, females feed directly from flowers. The food plants of this species include <em>Cirsium, Melilotus, Rubus, Rudbeckia, Solidago, Symphyotrichum, Trifolium&#160;</em>and <em>Vaccinium&#160;</em>(Williams <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;</p>  <p>This bee is a social parasite, and thus is found in association with its host species (Antonovics and Edwards 2011, Williams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Cuckoo bees often attack a broad range of host species, but some specialize in attacking the members of just one species or subgenus. In Europe,&#160;<em>Bombus bohemicus</em>&#160;is an inquiline primarily in the nests of&#160;<em>B. lucorum&#160;</em>(Rasmont&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).

In Europe, like its primary host,&#160;<em>B. bohemicus</em>&#160;can be found in a wide variety of habitats, from open grasslands, to sand dunes, heather moorland, woodland edge and subalpine grasslands (Rasmont <em>et al. </em>2014). In North America, this species' hosts nest in abandoned, underground, rodent burrows. Although overwintering specifics of this bee are unknown, most bumblebees overwinter in mulch, rotting logs, or loose soil (Plath 1934, Macfarlane 1974). &#160;</p>","<em><strong>North America</strong></em><br/>Despite an increase in bumblebee surveys, and re-sampling of historic locations in North America, there have been very few individuals of this species collected. At the regional level, surveys in southern Ontario (Colla and Packer 2008) and New York State (Giles and Ascher 2006) did not detect this species despite it being present at the same sites historically. Colla <em>et al</em>. (2012) found significant declines in relative abundance across this species Canada and United States range. The species was also found to only persist in 35% of historical sites which were re-sampled between 1991-2009 (Colla <em>et al</em>. 2012).

North of the 45th parallel, populations of this species typically live in the plains, mainly in Ericaceae dominated habitats; further south, it is a montane species. In Lithuania, it is recognized as being widely distributed but more abundant in the forest landscape, especially in forest bogs, and areas with <em>Calluna vulgaris</em> (Rasmont <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In North America, this species occurs in tundra/taiga habitats (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014).

Example food plants include <em>Epilobium</em>, <em>Melilotus</em>, <em>Potentilla</em>, and <em>Senecio</em> (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Bumble bees, as a whole, are eusocial insects that live in colonies composed of a queen, workers, and reproductives (males and new queens). Colonies are annual and only the new, mated queens overwinter. These queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. Nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles, or cavities in dead trees. Initially, the queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Bumble bees collect both nectar and pollen of the plants that they pollinate. In general, bumble bees forage from a diversity of plants, although bumble bee species in a given area can vary greatly in their plant preferences, largely due to differences in tongue length. Bumble bees are well-known to engage in “buzz pollination,” a very effective foraging technique in which they sonicate the flowers to vibrate the pollen loose from the anthers.","<em><strong>Europe</strong></em><br/>In Europe, due to the difficulties with species identification, there is no useful information available on the population trends in this species (Rasmont <em>et al</em>. 2014). <br/><br/><em><strong>Asia</strong></em><br/>Population trends in Asia are unknown. <br/><br/><em><strong>North America</strong></em><br/>In North America, <em>Bombus cryptarum</em> has expanded its range southward in recent years.

This represents a rate of spread over the last 20 years of about 4 km/year. The simplest hypothesis that can account for this change is that it is just a continuation of the natural expansion of its range since the end of the last ice age. An alternative hypothesis is that it is filling the niche vacated as a result of the decline in another species, <em>Bombus occidentalis</em>. It is also increasing in abundance in the Kananaskis region of Alberta (Owen <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Hatfield <em>et al</em>.

In Europe, <em>B. flavidus</em> is recorded as a parasite of colonies of bumble bees in the subgenus<em> Pyrobombus </em>(Løken&#160;1984). It is also the most common cuckoo species found in nests of <em>Pyrobombus </em>in North America, but surprisingly there are no direct records of it breeding in host colonies of any species from North America. It has also been recorded as present in the nests of<em> B. rufocinctus, B. occidentalis, and B. appositus</em>. Nesting occurs exclusively in the nests of other bees. <em>&#160;</em>&#160;<br/><br/>In Europe, it can be found in subalpine/subarctic and low alpine habitats and, in the north, boreal forest (Løken 1984).

Although little is known about the overwintering habits of <em>Bombus affinis</em>, queens of other species frequently dig a few centimetres into soft, disturbed soil and form an oval shaped chamber in which she will spend the duration of the winter. Compost in gardens or mole hills may provide suitable sites for queens to overwinter (Goulson 2010). Queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. <em>Bombus affinis&#160;</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">is&#160;one of the earliest species to emerge in North America, with queens typically emerging from hibernation as early as March or April (Milliron 1971, Colla and Dumesh 2010,&#160;Williams <em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2014,&#160;reviewed in<em>&#160;</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Jepsen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">2013). </span></span></p>  <p>In general, bumble bee nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles or cavities in dead trees.

Thus, nesting sites may be limited by the abundance of rodents.</span></p>  <p>After establishing a nest, the bumble bee queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Colonies of <em>B. affinis</em> are considered large compared to other species of bumble bees, producing up to 1,000 workers throughout the season (Macfarlane <em>et al.</em> 1994). New queens and males are produced during the later stages of colony development, generally from mid-July or August to September in this species (Plath 1922, Milliron 1971, Macfarlane<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;1994).

Nectar is a critical source of carbohydrates for bumble bees, and pollen provides essential protein. The amount of pollen available to bumble bee colonies during the growing season directly affects the number of queens that can be produced (Burns 2004). This, in turn impacts future bumble bee population levels. <em>Bombus affinis</em> probably needs floral resources to be located in relative close proximity to its nest sites, as studies of other bumble bee species indicate that they routinely forage within less than one kilometre of their nests (reviewed in<span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>&#160;</em>Jepsen<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>&#160;</em>2013).</span></span></p>  <p><em>Bombus affinis</em> is a short-tongued species (Williams <em>et al. </em>2014), typically found on open flowers and those with short corollas rather than flowers with deep corollas. Colla and Dumesh (2010) suggest that&#160;<em>B. affinis</em>&#160;is likely dependent upon woodland spring ephemeral flowers, since this bumble bee emerges early in the year and is associated with woodland habitats. This species&#160;is reported from a wide variety of wild plants including&#160;<em>Aesculus, Agastache, Dalea, Eupatorium, Helianthus, Impatiens, Lonicera, Monarda, Prunus, Solidago, </em>and&#160;<em>Vaccinum </em>(Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).

This same study concluded that the relative abundance of <em>B. affinis </em>has declined by 95%; the species was only detected at low numbers in three Illinois locations and one Indiana location in the recent survey (Cameron <em>et al. </em>2011a). A separate analysis of nearly 45,000 eastern bumble bee records from museum collections and contemporary surveys considering both Canada and the U.S. concluded that <em>B. affinis </em>has undergone a greater than a 70% range decline (persisting in less than 30% of re-sampled historically occupied 50 x 50 km grid cells throughout its United States and Canada range). The relative abundance of <em>B. affinis </em>&#160;from 1991-2009 was 87% less than its relative abundance in collections from &lt;1931-2000 (Colla <em>et al.</em> 2012). Similarly, a 2004-2006 study of approximately 9,000 bumble bees from 28 sites where&#160;<em>B. affinis&#160;</em>historically occurred in southern Ontario, plus 15 sites within the bee’s historic range in eastern North America, found that this species significantly decreased in relative abundance between the 1970-1973 and 2004-2006 survey periods (Colla and Packer 2008). In fact, only a single bee of this species was detected in the recent survey period, despite numerous reports that the species was historically common (Colla and Packer 2008). In the Northeastern United States, a long-term study of relative abundance changes of the entire regional bee fauna (based on &gt;30,000 museum records over a 140-year period),&#160;found&#160;<em>B. affinis</em>&#160;to be one of three bees (out of 438 species) that have exhibited a rapid and recent population collapse (Bartomeus&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p><p><u>Regional declines:</u>&#160;In addition to range-wide declines, numerous regional studies have found local extirpations and declines in relative abundance and distribution in this species (reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). For example, in a study of 56 sites across Illinois, comparisons between recent surveys and historic records of&#160;<em>B. affinis&#160;</em>revealed that the distribution of this species has decreased by nearly one third in that state since 2000, with only 67% of its pre-2000 distribution remaining (Grixti <em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). In Indiana, a multi-year survey of more than 880 bumble bees found just 25&#160;<em>B. affinis</em>&#160;specimens out of 217 (12%) in 2001, two out of 451 (0.004%) in 2002, and zero out of 553 in 2003 (reviewed in<em>&#160;</em>Jepsen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). In Minnesota, a survey of 464 bumble bees at Long Lake Regional Park found 98 rusty patched bumble bee individuals in 1994-1995, whereas surveys during the summers of 2007 and 2008 at the same park found no&#160;<em>B. affinis</em>&#160;among&#160;the 593 bumble bees recorded (reviewed in<em>&#160;</em>Jepsen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Since         2011,&#160;<em></em><em>B.       affinis</em>&#160;has been found in nearby       parks, although in very small numbers (10 out of 3,235 bumble bees recorded between 2011 and 2014; E. Evans&#160;pers. comm. 2014).&#160;In New York, a 2003 survey including over 1,261 bumble bees failed to find any members of this species, despite this species historically considered “moderately abundant” in the state, and well represented in historical collections from the region (Giles and Ascher 2006). A study by Colla and Packer (2008) of two sites in southern Ontario comparing a recent collection of nearly 1,200 bumble bees to a historical collection (Macfarlane 1974) of &gt;3,600 bumble bees from the same locations revealed that the rusty patched bumble bee had been extirpated from both sites, despite the fact that it comprised approximately 14% of the 1970s collection. Similarly, P. Williams reported that the rusty patched bumble bee was formerly abundant in Toronto, Ontario in 1983 but was not seen during regular surveys in the Toronto area from 2003 to 2008 (reviewed in<em>&#160;</em>Jepsen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). In Maryland, a sample of nearly 1,000 bumble bees on the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge from 2002 to 2007 found a single&#160;<em>B. affinis</em>&#160;specimen in 2002, and none since, despite this species being numerous in collections in the 1980s in this area. In the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee, where <em>B. affinis</em>&#160;was once abundant, this species<em> </em>has not been seen since 2000. In North Carolina, surveys of spring queens consistently found this species from 1995 to 2001, yet between 2002 and 2007, no queens of this species were found, despite the detection of other bumble bee species (reviewed in<em>&#160;</em>Jepsen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). In Virginia, a recent survey of bee populations at 17 sites detected just one <em>B. affinis</em>&#160;among nearly 35,000 bees&#160;collected and examined in the study (Smithsonian Science 2014).</p><p>We evaluated this species’ range-wide spatial distribution over time using a measure of change in the&#160;extent of occurrence (EOO; see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2014). We also assessed changes in the species’ relative abundance (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), which we consider to be an index of abundance relevant to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012). For all three calculations we divided the database into historical (1805-2001, N=128,572) and current (2002-2012, N=74,682) records. This timeframe was chosen to meet the IUCN criteria stipulation that species decline must have been observed over the longer of three generations or 10 years. Average decline for this species was calculated by averaging the change in abundance, persistence, and EOO.&#160;We used these measures of change between the recent and historic time periods to estimate the population trend that has occurred in the past 10 years, and to inform the application of an IUCN category.&#160;This analysis yielded the following results (see also the graph in Supplementary Material of relative abundance and map of change in EOO over time):</p><ul>  <li>Current      range size relative to historic range: 54.68%</li>  <li>Persistence      in current range relative to historic occupancy: 29.77%</li>  <li>Current      relative abundance relative to historic values: 7.46%</li>  <li>Average      decline: 69.36%</li> </ul><p>          </p><p>The relative abundance graph of this species over time illustrates that the relative abundance of this species in the past decade is lower than any other decade (see Figure 1 in Supplementary Material).

46440201,44937492,Vulnerable,A2be,2015,2014-12-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Bumble bees are primitively eusocial insects that live in colonies made up of one queen, female workers and, near the end of the season, reproductive members of the colony (new queens, or gynes, and males). New colonies are initiated by solitary queens, generally in the early spring. This process includes locating a suitable nest site; collecting pollen and nectar from flowers; building a wax structure to store nectar; forming a mass of pollen to lay eggs on; and building a wax structure to enclose the eggs and pollen. <em>Bombus occidentalis</em>, like most other species of bumble bees, typically nests underground in abandoned rodent burrows or other cavities (Hobbs 1968, MacFarlane <em>et al. </em>1994, Plath 1922, Thorp <em>et al. </em>1983). Most reports of&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;nests are from underground cavities such as old squirrel or other animal nests and in open west-southwest slopes bordered by trees, although a few nests have been reported from above-ground locations such as in logs among railroad ties (Hobbs 1968, MacFarlane&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1994, Plath 1922, Thorp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1983). Availability of nests sites for&#160;<em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>may depend on rodent abundance (Evans&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). Nest tunnels have been reported to be up to 2.1 m long for this species and the nests may be lined with grass or bird feathers (MacFarlane&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1994).</p><p>Once the colony has been initiated by the queen and the first brood of female workers have grown, pupated and emerged as adults, the female workers take over all duties of foraging for pollen and nectar, colony defense and feeding larvae. The queen’s only responsibility at this point is to lay eggs. <em>Bombus occidentalis </em>colonies can contain as many as 1,685 workers and produce up to 360 new queens; this colony size is considered large relative to many other species of bumble bees (MacFarlane <em>et al.</em> 1994). According to Thorp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(1983), the flight period for&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;queens in California is from early February to late November, peaking in late June and late September. The flight period for workers and males in California is from early April to early November; worker abundance peaks in early August, and male abundance peaks in early September (Thorp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1983). In the late summer or fall, depending on the bumble bee species and elevation, colonies produce reproductive individuals (males and gynes), which leave the colony and mate. Males of this species patrol in circuits in search of mates (Williams<em> et al. </em>2014). As winter approaches, the old queen, workers, and males die, while the gynes continue to forage for nectar, then find a suitable location (hibernacula), usually burrowed a few centimeters underground, in which to spend the winter. Very little is known about the hibernacula, or overwintering sites, utilized by&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>,<em>&#160;</em>although Hobbs (1968) reported&#160;<em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>hibernacula that were two inches deep in a “steep west slope of the mound of earth.” The closely related&#160;<em>B. terrestris&#160;</em>reportedly hibernates beneath trees (Hobbs 1968).&#160;The newly mated queens store sperm until they initiate a colony the following spring.</p>Bumble bees, including <em>B. occidentalis</em>, are generalist foragers and have been reported visiting a wide variety of flowering plants.&#160;Bumble bees require plants that bloom and provide adequate nectar and pollen throughout the colony’s life cycle, which is from early February to late November for&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;(although the actual dates likely vary by elevation). The amount of pollen available to foragers directly affects the number of new queens that a bumble bee colony can produce, and since queens are the only type of bumble bees that can form new colonies, pollen availability directly affects the future bumble bee population size (Burns 2004). Early spring and late fall are often periods with lower floral resources; the presence of flowering plants at these critical times is essential.&#160;<em>Bombus occidentalis </em>has a short tongue, and thus is best suited to forage at open flowers with short corollas. In addition to foraging at the open face of flowers, <em>B. occidentalis</em> is also known to engage in a behavior called ‘nectar robbing’ in which a hole is chewed in the base of flowers with long corollas to obtain nectar without actually facilitating plant pollination (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2014). Rangewide, example food plants of&#160;<em>Bombus occidentalis&#160;</em>include <em>Ceanothus, Centaurea, Chrysothamnus, Cirsium, Geranium, Grindellia, Lupinus, Melilotus, Monardella, Rubus, Solidago, </em>and <em>Trifolium </em>(Williams <em>et al. </em>2014). In Oregon and Washington, the plant genera most commonly associated with&#160;<em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>observations or collections include:&#160;<em>Trifolium&#160;</em>(20 observations),&#160;<em>Cirsium&#160;</em>(12),&#160;<em>Rubus&#160;</em>(7),&#160;<em>Solidago</em>&#160;(6),&#160;<em>Epilobium&#160;</em>(5),&#160;<em>Spiraea&#160;</em>(5),&#160;<em>Tilia&#160;</em>(5),&#160;<em>Cicuta&#160;</em>(4),&#160;<em>Heracleum&#160;</em>(3), and&#160;<em>Plantago&#160;</em>(3) (database supporting Williams&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014). Similarly, in an analysis largely based on records from California, Thorp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(1983) reports that&#160;<em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>records are primarily associated with plants in the Leguminosae (=Fabaceae), Compositae (=Asteraceae), Rhamnaceae, and Rosaceae families. Note that these floral associations do not necessarily represent&#160;<em>B. occidentalis’&#160;</em>preference for these plants over other flowering plants, but rather may represent the abundance of these flowers in the landscape.<br/>The habitat for this species is described as open grassy areas, urban parks and gardens, chaparral and shrub areas, and mountain meadows&#160;&#160;(Williams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160;This species is host to the cuckoo bee&#160;<em>Bombus suckleyi, </em>based on a confirmed breeding record. It is likely that this species is also a host to <em>B. bohemicus </em>(=<em>ashtoni</em>), <em>B. insularis, </em>and <em>B. flavidus&#160;</em>(=<em>fernaldi</em>)&#160;(Williams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).","<p>Multiple studies indicate that&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;has declined, both range-wide and       locally, especially in the southern and western portions of its       range. Ongoing surveys targeting the&#160;IUCN Critically Endangered&#160;<em>Bombus franklini</em>&#160;in       southern Oregon and northern California have revealed alarming       declines not only in&#160;<em>B. franklini&#160;</em>but also in&#160;<em>B.       occidentalis</em>&#160;(Thorp 2008, R.

Both species comprised 11-12% of       the records at the start of the study in 1998, but, in parallel,       have exhibited precipitous declines&#160;in relative abundance in the years since (Thorp       2008). Specifically,&#160;<em>Bombus&#160;</em><em>franklini&#160;</em>was not found in 2004 or 2005, one       individual was seen in 2006, and the species has not been detected       any year since. <em>Bombus       occidentalis</em>&#160;was not detected during       any surveys 2003 through 2007, and has been seen only in very low       numbers (one to seven per year) each year from 2008 to 2014 (R.       Thorp pers. comm. 2014<em></em>).&#160;</p><p>In a study comparing current and historical distributions of eight bumble bee species in the United States using museum records and nationwide survey data, Cameron&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2011a) found&#160;that&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;has undergone a 28% range decline between recent (2007-2009) and historic (1900-1999) time periods. Despite <em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>historically having&#160;among the broadest geographic ranges of any bumble bee species in North America, the 2007-2009 surveys detected the species only throughout the Intermountain West and Rocky Mountains; it was largely absent from the western portion of its range. The relative abundance of this species also significantly declined between the time periods examined, in both of the regions examined (Pacific West and Intermountain West) (Cameron <em>et al. </em>2011a). It has experienced serious declines across most of its range in Oregon and Washington, while still occurring in relatively high abundance in northeastern Oregon (Rao<em> et al. </em>2011). The species also remains common in some of the northern parts of its range, such as Alaska and the Yukon (Koch and Strange 2012, S.

In the past decade, this species' relative abundance has declined from 0.035 to 0.018 (<em>c. </em>50%; see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material). If this species' long term relative abundance trend continues at the same rate, it will cross the x axis in 60-70 years&#160;(Hatfield&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014). These results are consistent with findings from other studies, discussed above (e.g., Cameron <em>et al. </em>2011, Thorp 2008). Overall, the species has declined dramatically in parts of its historic range, sometimes to the point of local extirpation. Where it remains detectable, we infer that it occurs at lower abundances than historically.

Commercial rearing of this species began in 1992, with two origins. Some colonies were produced in rearing facilities in California by a company which imported the technology for rearing bumble bees and applied it to rearing&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;locally in California. This same year, a distributor for a competitor which did not have rearing facilities in North America at the time was granted permits by&#160;the US Department of Agriculture – Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) for a three year window of time (1992-1994) to export queens of&#160;<em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>B. impatiens</em>&#160;to European rearing facilities for colony production. Following rearing, these colonies were then shipped back to the U.S. for commercial pollination.&#160;In 1997, commercial producers began experiencing problems with disease (<em>Nosema</em>)&#160;in the production of <em>B. occidentalis</em> (Flanders <em>et al. </em>2003). Eventually, the availability of <em>B. occidentalis</em> became critically low, and western crop producers who had become dependent on pollination provided by this species began requesting that APHIS allow the shipment and use of <em>B. impatiens</em> in western states (Flanders <em>et al. </em>2003).&#160;In 1998, the USDA-APHIS issued permits to allow <em>B. impatiens </em>to be used in the western U.S. However, within a few years, the USDA-APHIS stopped regulating the interstate movement of bumble bees altogether, citing their lack of regulatory authority. <em>Bombus occidentalis </em>is no longer bred and sold commercially and <em>B. impatiens</em> is used widely in the western U.S. (Xerces Society<a> <em>et al.</em> 2010).</a></p>",Terrestrial,"<p></p><p><u>Research Needs:</u> Taxonomic work is in progress to formally distinguish two subspecies of <em>B. occidentalis</em>, the&#160;northern (including Alaska and northern British Columbia) and southern (including the western contiguous United States and southern British Columbia) populations, each of which have distinctive haplotype groups that correspond with morphological differences&#160;(reviewed in Jepsen and Foltz Jordan 2013).&#160;This work to describe two subspecies of <em>B. occidentalis </em>will have important conservation implications, since the northern subspecies, occurring primarily in Alaska and parts of British Columbia, appears to be abundant and stable, whereas the southern subspecies has undergone a dramatic decline. Once the subspecies are described, the southern subspecies will be considered more at risk than it was previously. &#160;</p><p>Since the prevailing theory on the decline and localized extirpation of <em>B. occidentalis</em> suggests pathogen transmission of&#160;<em>Nosema bombi</em>&#160;across wild populations, further work is needed to assess possible genetic differences in the strain of<em>&#160;N. bombi&#160;</em>associated with Alaskan&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;(Koch and Strange 2012), and/or&#160;genetic differences in the Alaskan&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;that may reduce <em>N. bombi </em>susceptibility. &#160;In the Alaskan study, <em>B. occidentalis</em> was arguably the most abundant bumble bee, despite it having the highest prevalence of <em>N. bombi&#160;</em>(Koch and Strange 2012).&#160;</p><p><u>Survey Needs:</u>&#160;Once very common in the western United States and western Canada, <em>B. occidentalis </em>has recently undergone a dramatic decline in abundance and distribution, and is no longer present across much of the historic range.

Colonies are annual and only the new, mated queens overwinter. These queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. Nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles, or cavities in dead trees. Initially, the queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Bumble bees collect both nectar and pollen of the plants that they pollinate. In general, bumble bees forage from a diversity of plants, although bumble bee species in a given area can vary greatly in their plant preferences, largely due to differences in tongue length. Bumble bees are well-known to engage in “buzz pollination,” a very effective foraging technique in which they sonicate the flowers to vibrate the pollen loose from the anthers.</p><p><em>Bombus terricola</em> inhabits a wide variety of habitats, including woodlands, farmlands, urban areas, meadows, grasslands, wetlands and other areas (Hobbs 1968, Laverty and Harder 1988, Williams&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).

A study examining&#160;changes in bumble bee community composition throughout Illinois found that although <em>B. terricola</em> made up 1.2% relative abundance of the bumble bees from collections from 1900-1949, it was not present in state collections from 1950-2007 or from extensive surveys performed at 56 sites across the state in 2007, and is now considered locally extirpated (Grixti <em>et al.</em> 2009). Although this species was historically rare in Illinois (15 bees collected from three sites between 1894 and 1929), records from multiple geographic regions and years indicate that it was not a transient species (Grixti <em>et al.</em> 2009). In a study in Guelph, Ontario, a comparison of relative abundances of bumble bees collected from 1971-1973 and from 2004-2006 found that&#160;<em>B. terricola</em>&#160;significantly declined in relative abundance from 3% to 0% between the two time periods (Colla and Packer 2008). Also in Ontario, Dr. Paul Williams reports that while this species was one of the most common in Toronto and Algonquin in 1983, Dr. Williams&#160;saw only two individuals in Toronto and none in the eastern&#160;United States during surveys between 2002 and 2008 (P. Williams pers. comm. 2014). In Manitoba, Turnock&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2006) reported declining abundance of this species in the period of 1986-1993, based on bycatch in baited armyworm traps.&#160;</p><p>A recent&#160;long-term study in the Northeastern United States examining historical changes in bees (including both&#160;<em>Bombus&#160;</em>and&#160;non-<em>Bombus&#160;</em>bees) found that although this species did not exhibit the rapid and drastic population declines seen in&#160;<em>B. ashtoni, B. pensylvanicus </em>and&#160;<em>B. affinis,&#160;</em>it did exhibit significant declines in relative abundance across its northeastern U.S. range (Bartomeus<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2013).&#160;In another study comparing current and historical distributions of eight bumble bee species in the United States using museum records and nationwide survey data, Cameron <em>et al.</em> (2011) found that the relative abundances of <em>B. terricola</em>&#160;had sharply declined in recent years, from ~10% relative abundance to &lt;1%, in comparison with the codistributed <em>B. impatiens,</em>&#160;<em>B. bimaculatus</em>, <em>B. pensylvanicus </em>and <em>B. affinis</em>. In this study, intensive survey efforts of &gt;16,000 bees in 40 states (2007-2009) identified only 32 specimens of <em>B. terricola</em> at nine sites (in North Carolina, Maine, Vermont, Pennsylvania and South Dakota), and the quantified range reduction of this species compared to historical records was estimated at 31% (Cameron <em>et al.</em> 2011). In another comprehensive study of bumble bee decline across both the United States and Canada, Colla <em>et al. </em>(2012) found this species persisted in&#160;approximately 52%&#160;of re-sampled historically occupied 50 x 50 km grid cells throughout its United States and Canada range, and although abundance had a downward slope, this trend was not significant. This study notes that although previous studies found <em>B. terricola</em>&#160;to be among the most sharply declining species (Cameron <em>et al.</em> 2011, Colla and Packer 2008), declines are not as striking when the northernmost parts of the range are considered (Colla<em> et al. </em>2012). &#160;</p><p>We evaluated this species’ spatial distribution range-wide over time using a measure of change in the&#160;extent of occurrence (EOO; see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield<em> et al.</em> 2014). We also assessed changes in the species’ relative abundance (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), which we consider to be an index of abundance relevant to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012).

As such, these bees do not found their own nests, but instead, usurp the colonies and worker forces of other bumble bee species. To do this, a mated female enters the nest of another bumble bee species, kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and forcibly (using pheromones and/or physical attacks) ""enslaves"" the workers of that colony to feed her and her developing young. Since all of the resulting cuckoo bee offspring are reproductive (not workers), they leave the colony to mate, and the mated females seek out other nests to attack. Males of this species patrol circuits in search of mates. Before finding and invading a host colony, females feed directly from flowers. The adult food plants of this species include <em>""Aster"", Chrysothamnus, Cirsium, </em>and <em>Solidago</em>&#160;(Williams<em> et al.</em> 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Cuckoo bee nesting occurs exclusively in the nests of other bees.

Example food plants include&#160;<em>Arctostaphylos, Ceanothus, Chrysothamnus, Cirsium, Eriogonum, Eschscholzia, Lupinus, Phacelia, Rhododendron, Ribes, Vicia, Ericameria, Clarkia </em>and <em>Grindelia</em>.&#160;Males patrol in circuits in search of mates&#160;(Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;<em>Bombus vosnesenskii&#160;</em>is an early emerging, dominant species that can out-compete other bumble bees in some areas, and may be attributed to apparent declines in some bees, such as&#160;<em>Bombus sitkensis</em>, which also uses rodent holes as nest sites (McFrederick and LeBuhn 2006). It tends to be less dominant in natural areas (Nature Serve 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Bumble bees, as a whole, are eusocial insects that live in colonies composed of a queen, workers and reproductives (males and new queens). Colonies are annual and only the new, mated queens overwinter. These queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. Nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles, or cavities in dead trees. Initially, the queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Bumble bees collect both nectar and pollen of the plants that they pollinate. In general, bumble bees forage from a diversity of plants, although bumble bee species in a given area can vary greatly in their plant preferences, largely due to differences in tongue length. Bumble bees are well-known to engage in “buzz pollination,” a very effective foraging technique in which they sonicate the flowers to vibrate the pollen loose from the anthers.","This is one of the most common bumble bee species on the West Coast of North America, where it appears to be increasing in abundance relative to other bumble bees.&#160;<span id=""docs-internal-guid-7a0c2221-a46a-ac5b-9c30-7de5b66251ab"">It is apparently tolerant of urban and at least some agricultural environments, being one of the few bumblebees still found regularly in San Francisco (McFrederick and LeBuhn 2006), and a very common and important wild pollinator in agricultural fields in the Willamette Valley in Oregon (Rao and Stephen 2010). In a study of blueberry and red-clover fields in the Willamette Valley, Rao and Stephen (2010) found this species at all five sites examined, where it comprised 52.55% of all bumble bee visitors on blueberry blooms, and 92.23% of all bumble bee visitors on red clover.&#160;Fraser <em>et al. </em>(2012) detail the&#160;significant and rapid range extension this species has undergone in British Columbia. Since 2000, the species has expanded north in the Okanagan Valley, west to the Similkameen Valley and, especially, has become firmly established in south coastal regions of the province, including Vancouver Island. Population increases in <em>B. vosnesenskii</em> to the south of British Columbia have also been reported (Fraser <em>et al. </em>2012).

As such, these bees do not found their own nests, but instead, usurp the colonies and worker forces of other bumble bee species. To do this, a mated female enters the nest of another bumble bee species, kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and forcibly (using pheromones and/or physical attacks) ""enslaves"" the workers of that colony to feed her and her developing young. Since all of the resulting cuckoo bee offspring are reproductives (not workers), they leave the colony to mate, and then they hibernate. The next year, after emerging from hibernation, the mated females seek out other nests to attack. Males of this species patrol circuits in search of mates (Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Before finding and invading a host colony, females feed directly from flowers. The adult food plants of this species include asters, <em>Cirsium, Eupatorium, Liatris, Pycnanthemum, Solidago </em>and <em>Veronia </em>(Williams <em>et al. </em>2014).</p><p>Cuckoo bees often attack a broad range of host species, but some specialize in attacking the members of just one species or subgenus. <em>Bombus citrinus</em> is a parasite of&#160;<em>Bombus&#160;</em><em>bimaculatus, B.&#160;</em><em>impatiens, </em>and <em>B. vagans</em> (Fischer 1985, Laverty and Harder 1988, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2014), with <em>B. impatiens</em> being a less preferred host due to its ability to defend against invasion better than <em>B. vagans</em> (Fischer 1985). However the relationships amongst bumble bee parasites of this sub-genus and their hosts are not well known (Strange <em>et al</em>. 2014), and other studies suggest that <em>Bombus impatiens</em> is the primary host (e.g. NatureServe 2013). While this bee may try to invade the nests of other bumble bee species (e.g.<em> Bombus terricola</em>) (Plath 1922) and even honey bee hives (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) (Plath 1927 cited in Strange <em>et al</em>. 2014), it is usually unsuccessful, with the intruder being killed off. When this cuckoo bumble bee successfully takes over the nest of a host species, it kills off or represses the queen of the host species, and uses the workers produced by the host species' queen before the nest was invaded to rear the parasite's offspring (Antonovics and Edwards 2011, Strange <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>  <p>While this species is noted as emerging late in the spring in Illinois (Medler and Carney 1963 cited in Grixti <em>et al.&#160;</em>2009) and Eastern Canada (Laverty and Harder 1988), it was reported to be active in early spring in Ontario (Collla and Dumesh 2010). It is active close to or within wooded areas until late fall (Colla and Dumesh 2010).

In a study of 56 sites across Illinois, this bee was present historically but not recollected between 1950 and 1999, nor between 2000 and 2007. The authors suggest this species to be locally extirpated from the state, but note that it was very rare historically (two bees collected from a single site between 1927 and 1929) and may represent a transient species, especially since Illinois is on the edge of this species' range.</p><p>We evaluated this species’ spatial distribution over time using a measure of change in the&#160;extent of occurrence (EOO; see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield<em> et al. </em>2014). We also assessed changes in the species’ relative abundance (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), which we consider to be an index of abundance relevant to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012). For all three calculations we divided the database into historical (1805-2001, N=128,572) and current (2002-2012, N=74,682) records. This timeframe was chosen to meet the IUCN criteria stipulation that species decline must have been observed over the longer of three generations or 10 years. Average decline for this species was calculated by averaging the change in abundance, persistence, and EOO. This analysis yielded the following results (see also the graph in Supplementary Material of relative abundance and map of change in EOO over time):</p><li>Current range size relative to historic range: 69.05%</li><li>Persistence in current range relative to historic occupancy: 103.61%</li><li>Current relative abundance relative to historic values: 162.21%</li><li>Average decline: 0.00% &#160;</li><p></p><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">This analysis, consistent with other studies discussed above, suggests this species has not experienced serious declines in relative abundance, persistence, or range in recent years. &#160;</p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">For a graph and map of relative abundance and range changes of this species over time, see the Supplementary Material.</span></p>",Stable,"<em>Bombus ternarius</em>&#160;is found in the Canadian Maritimes and Eastern Temperate Forest and Boreal Forest regions of Canada and the&#160;United States, west through North Dakota and Canadian Great Plains, scattered in the Mountain West to British Columbia (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>For a graph and map of relative abundance and range changes of this species over time, see the Supplementary Material.",,Terrestrial,"<p>Specific conservation and research needs for this species have not been identified.

Hobbs (1964) describes nest establishment, construction of brood cells, and brood care in this species.&#160;<em>Bombus&#160;</em><em>kirbiellus</em><em>&#160;</em>is a pocket-maker when rearing worker larvae to the last instar, and a pollen-storer when rearing last-instar worker, male, and queen larvae (Hobbs 1964).&#160;<em><br/></em><em><br/></em>Bumble bees, as a whole, are eusocial insects that live in colonies composed of a queen, workers, and reproductives (males and new queens). Colonies are annual and only the new, mated queens overwinter. These queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. Nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles, or cavities in dead trees. Initially, the queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Bumble bees collect both nectar and pollen of the plants that they pollinate. In general, bumble bees forage from a diversity of plants, although bumble bee species in a given area can vary greatly in their plant preferences, largely due to differences in tongue length. Bumble bees are well-known to engage in “buzz pollination,” a very effective foraging technique in which they sonicate the flowers to vibrate the pollen loose from the anthers.","<em>Bombus kirbiellus</em>&#160;appears to be common in high latitude boreal and arctic parts of the range.&#160;In most of North America,&#160;this species has not been reported in decline, although&#160;this could reflect lack of information rather than lack of threat or decline (NatureServe 2014). Much of the range is remote and little to no information on bumble bee status is available from such places. Many records cannot be relied upon until they can be checked.

We also assessed changes in the species’ relative       abundance, which we consider to be an index of abundance relevant       to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and       Criteria (IUCN 2012).

As such, these bees do not found their own nests, but instead, usurp the colonies and worker forces of other bumble bee species. To do this, a mated female enters the nest of another bumble bee species, kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and forcibly (using pheromones and/or physical attacks) ""enslaves"" the workers of that colony to feed her and her developing young. Since all of the resulting cuckoo bee offspring are reproductive (not workers), they leave the colony to mate, and the mated females seek out other nests to attack.<br/><br/>Cuckoo bees often attack a broad range of host species, but some specialize in attacking the members of just one species or subgenus. <em>Bombus natvigi</em> is recorded as usually breeding as a parasite in colonies of <em>B. polaris</em> (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). Males of this species patrol circuits in search of mates. Before finding and invading a host colony, females feed directly from flowers.

100240441,21215142,Endangered,A2abce,2016,2016-09-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p>This species occupies the southernwest most portion of continental South America. As a consequence, it is the southernmost bumblebee species in the world. This is a typical species of the broadleaf and mixed forest biome (according to Olson 2001 classification of global biomes), and in the near past it was very common in the following terrestrial ecoregions: Valdivian Temperate Forests, Magellanic Subpolar Forests (both ecoregions characterized by broadleaf <em>Nothofagus </em>spp. forest types), more or less common in the ecoregions of Chilean Matorral (associated to remnant and relictual hygrophyllous forests) and less common in particular suitable habitats in the Southern Andes Steppe and Patagonia Steppe. It has also been frequently recorded in open vegetation communities of lake margins (C. Morales pers. obs.) and mountain meadows. Although there have been a few records in the ecoregions of Argentine Monte, Argentine Spinal and humid Pampas, it is probably extirpated from all these ecoregions.<br/><br/>This species nests in cavities in the soil, below trunks, sphagnum, soil and roots, and nests are small compared with those of other <em>Bombus </em>species (Claude-Joseph 1926, Montealegre 1927, Ruiz 1939, Montalva <em>et al</em>. 2011). This species was commonly observed foraging in gardens of small towns, although nests have not been reported in such urban areas. Regarding foraging ecology, <em>B. dahlbomii </em>is a long tongued bumblebee, that visits flowers of a broad spectrum of colours, sizes and shapes of a high diversity of plant families, including Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Myrtaceae, Lamiaceae and Rosaceae among other common families (Montalva <em>et al</em>. 2011, Abrahamovich <em>et al</em>. 2001, Morales unpublished). Overall, this species has been recorded in more than 90 native and introduced plant species of&#160; greater than 40 families (Abrahamovich <em>et al</em>. 2001, Morales and Aizen 2010, Montalva <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><em>Bombus dahlbomii </em>has been shown to play a key role in the structure and function of plant-pollinator networks of many communities (Vazquez and Simberloff 2003, Morales and Aizen 2006, Aizen et al. 2008, Ramos-Jiliberto <em>et al</em>. 2009). For instance, model simulations from a recent analysis of plant-pollinator networks revealed the importance of hymenopterans as pivotal groups that maintain the core structure of the pollination network and guarantee overall species persistence in the temperate forests of Chiloé Island. Among them, <em>B. dahlbomii</em> exerted a disproportionately large influence on the preservation of network structure. Thus, we foresee its extinction would seriously harm the reproductive success of plants in this temperate rain forest, and therefore recommend that <em>B. dahlbomii </em>should be considered as focal species for conservation programs given current threats from selective logging and habitat loss (Ramos-Jiliberto <em>et al</em>. 2009). In addition, <em>B. dahlbomii </em>is a key pollinator of many endemic plants like the lily <em>Alstroemeria aurea </em>(Aizen 2001).<br/><br/>With respect to relevant aspects of bee biology and genetics, in colonial bees only queens and drones are reproductive. In addition, <em>B. dahlbomii</em>, as with the rest of the social bees, can show a reduced heterozygosity due to the low effective population size. However, to estimate the effective population size in haplo-diploids is a complex task as a result of atypical and unknown sex ratio effects. No work has been done on this topic for this species, but it is safe to assume that effective population sizes are smaller and more vulnerable in most of the haplo-diploids than for diplo-diploid organisms with similar sex ratios and apparent population sizes. <br/><p></p>","<em>Bombus dahlbomii</em> was reported as abundant in the past, both in Argentina (Abrahamovich and Diaz 2001) and Chile (Montealegre 1927). However, there is a strong consensus, based on independent studies (Morales <em>et al</em>. 2013, Schmid-Hempel <em>et al</em>. 2014), and reports and observations (see personal communications and observations in this assessment) on a consistent decline of the species' abundance in both countries, including the extinction of local subpopulations in particular in the north-eastern part of its geographic range (see also the <em>Geographic Range</em> section). This retraction may have led to a range loss of &gt;54% of the extent of occurrence (EOO) in the last 10 years.<br/><br/>In Argentina, there is evidence of a strong decline in the northern portion of its range, where this species has been almost completely replaced by the invasive European Bumblebee (<em>Bombus terrestris</em>), and to a lesser extent <em>B. ruderatus</em> (Madjidian <em>et al</em>. 2008, Arbetman <em>et al</em>. 2012, Morales <em>et al</em>. 2013, Schmid-Hempel <em>et al</em>. 2014, Geslin and Morales 2015). Since the sequential invasion of these introduced bumblebee species, <em>B. dahlbomii</em> has become much harder to find. <em>Bombus ruderatus</em> was introduced to Chile in the 1980s and arrived in the Patagonia region of Argentina around 1994 (Roig Alsina and Aizen 1996); <em>B. terrestris</em> was introduced to Chile in 1997, and advanced eastward arriving in the Argentine range of B. dahlbomii around 2006 (Torreta <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>A broad scale survey during January-February 2011 (austral summer) along the eastern slope of the Andes from North Neuquén to South Santa Cruz (Arbetman <em>et al</em>. 2012, Morales <em>et al</em>. 2013), failed to find <em>B. dahlbomii </em>in areas where it was reported as abundant until 2004 (e.g., Challhuaco Valley and LlaoLlao Forest, in Río Negro Province, Aizen 2001, Morales and Aizen 2002, 2006, Vazquez and Simberloff 2003, Madjifian <em>et al</em>. 2004) and 2006 (e.g., near San Martin de los Andes, in Neuquén Province, Torreta <em>et al</em>. 2006). A comparison of the results of that survey with published maps of historical distribution based on museum collections (Abrahamovich and Diaz 2001, see also the <em>Geographic Range</em> section), shows that many subpopulations of the northern part of its historic geographic range (Neuquén and Río Negro and to a lesser extent Chubut) have suffered drastic reductions, or even disappeared, being replaced by invasive <em>Bombus terrestris</em> and to a lesser extent by <em>B. ruderatus</em> (Morales <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In 2011 only the southernmost subpopulations in southern Santa Cruz were still numerous, which coincided with the only locations in Argentina where <em>B. terrestris</em> had not yet arrived (see Fig. 2 and supplementary materials in Morales <em>et al</em>. 2013, see also Fig. 2 in Schmid-Hempel <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, an even more recent survey performed in December 2013 shows that these locations have been recently invaded by <em>B. terrestris</em> (Geslin and Morales 2015).&#160;&#160; By February 2014, M.A Aizen recorded similar abundances of <em>B. dahlbomii</em> and <em>B. terrestris</em> visiting flowers of <em>Gaultheria</em> spp. at the coast of Lago Argentino right in front of Perito Moreno glacier, Los Glaciares National Park (pers comm). Thus in just three years since first observed, <em>B. terrestris</em> has reached similar or higher (Geslin and Morales 2015) abundance than <em>B. dahlbomii</em>, which may vary among sites.<br/><br/>A two decade long study (1994-2013) at the Challhuaco Valley (Nahuel Huapi National Park, Río Negro, Argentina), where <em>B. dahlbomii</em> was the most frequent pollinator species of the lily <em>Alstroemeria aurea</em> in a large monospecific stand, reveals that since these surveys started in 1994 the abundance of this <em>B. dahlbomii</em> subpopulation declined until complete local extinction. Although <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was very abundant and common in this site during the mid-1990s (Aizen 2001 and references therein), the species started to decline after <em>B. ruderatus</em> invasion (Morales 2007, Madjidian <em>et al</em>. 2008, Aizen and Feinsinger 2003). This negative trend was exacerbated with <em>B. terrestris </em>invasion in 2007; in fact, since 2008 no <em>B. dahlbomii </em>has been recorded during comprehensive pollinator censuses (Arbetman <em>et al</em>. 2012, Morales <em>et al</em>. 2013). Therefore, the collapse of this once very large subpopulation was concurrent with the sequential invasion of the introduced European species <em>B. ruderatus </em>and <em>B. terrestris </em>(Morales <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In Chile, a rapid displacement of <em>B. dahlbomii </em>by <em>B. terrestris </em>has been reported by Schmid-Hempel <em>et al</em>. (2014), following a similar pattern of replacement from north to south as that described in Argentina by Morales <em>et al</em>. (2013). For instance, in 2004, the native <em>B. dahlbomii </em>and the introduced <em>B. ruderatus </em>were abundant around the Chilean Lake district of Villarrica–Pucon (IX Region). On the other hand, by 2010, <em>B. terrestris </em>had become the dominant species while <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was no longer found (Schmid-Hempel <em>et al</em>. 2014). During their 2010/2011 surveys, Schmid-Hempel <em>et al</em>. (2014) noticed clear boundaries between the advancing <em>B. terrestris </em>and the presence of the native <em>B. dahlbomii </em>in Southern Patagonia and around Lake General Carrera (XI Region, Schmid-Hempel <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Bombus dahlbomii</em> was clearly still abundant below that latitude in the XII Region (See Fig. 2 Schmid-Hempel <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, recent unpublished reports suggest that <em>B. dahlbomii </em>has drastically declined in this region after the recent invasion of <em>B. terrestris</em> (see below and the <em>Threats</em> section).<br/><br/>There have been reports of decline of <em>B. dahlbomii </em>throughout most of its historical range; however, this decline seems to be more drastic in the IV, V and Metropolitan Regions of Central Chile (Ruz and Vivallo 2005, Montalva <em>et al</em>. 2011; see per-region account below). Below, we provide an account of the available information region by region (from North to South). This information although scattered and preliminary, confirms a north to south declining trend.<br/><br/>In the IV Region (Coquimbo), (i.e. the northern limit of this species' range) the species was never abundant and always was constrained to relictual mountain forest areas (Toro and Chiappa 1997). This species was still extant, but very scarce, at&#160; Los Vilos in January 2013 (P. Novoa, pers. comm).<br/><br/>In the V Region (Valparaiso), although a recent survey of entomological collections (Smith-Ramirez, pers. obs.) revealed that the last specimens of this species were collected in 1974, there have been more recent reports of <em>B. dahlbomii </em>(Montalva, pers. comm). However, all of these partial observations coincide in the declining trend experienced by <em>B. dahlbomii </em>in this region. A study of bees in localities of Central-South (V Region) and South Chile (VIII Region), showed that in 2000 <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was still the most abundant species recorded (50%, n=812 bees), whereas the invasive <em>B. terrestris</em> accounted for only 10% (n=170 bees) of the apoidea (Ruz and Herrera 2001). Moreover, this invasive species was present in&#160; Central-South, but not in South Chile.<br/><br/>Overall, in 2010 the relative abundance of <em>B. dahlbomii </em>compared to that reported by Ruz and Herrera ten years ago (2001) had decreased in the V region. In 2010, E. Chiappa (pers. comm.) collected only one <em>B. dahlbomii </em>out 1,115 bees (0.09%) in Quebrada La Horquilla (QuebradaVerde) and only one out of 249 bees (0.4%) in Quebrada El Sapo (El Salto). Similarly, according to collecting records, in 2002 <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was abundant in sites like Laguna Verde, La Ligua, Palmar El Salto and Quebrada Alvarado. However, in 2009-2010 <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was already scarce in the Botanical Garden of El Salto, whereas <em>B. terrestris </em>was abundant. <em>Bombus dahlbomii</em> is no longer found in most of these areas, which are now dominated by <em>B. terrestris</em> (Montalva, pers. comm).<br/><br/>In the Metropolitan region, <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was reported as abundant in the Cerro San Cristobal (Santiago de Chile City) during the first quarter of the twentieth century (Ruiz 1923), but the last collections from the Metropolitan Regions are from 1996 (Smith-Ramirez, pers. comm). Currently the species has been reported for some cordilleran sectors like Yerba Loca, Valle Nevado and Farellones (J. Montalva, pers. comm., S. Rodríguez, pers. comm.), but it is no longer observed in the valley of the Metropolitan Region, which is dominated by <em>B. terrestris </em>(Montalva <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the VI Region, similar to the Metropolitan Region, <em>B. dahlbomii </em>seems to be extirpated in the central Valley, but still present in the Cordillera. In the VII Region, <em>B. dahlbomii </em>is very scarce, and only can be observed in protected areas of cordilleran valleys, whereas is completely absent from urban areas where <em>B. terrestris </em>is abundant (C. Avendaño, pers. comm).<br/><br/>In the VIII Region, in Cobquera near the Pacific coast, <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was the most abundant apoide in 2000 (&gt;50%) and the only bumblebee visiting <em>Eryngium paniculatum </em>(Ruz and Herrera 2001), while in 2005 <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was absent in the same area and the main pollinators of <em>E. paniculatum </em>were <em>B. terrestris </em>and <em>B. ruderatus </em>(L. Ruz, pers. comm). Moreover, in 2013, C. Tobar (pers. comm.) did not observe any <em>B. dahlbomii</em>, or <em>B. ruderatus</em>, but only <em>B. terrestris</em>. Thus, <em>B. dahlbomii </em>seems to have been progressively replaced by <em>B. ruderatus </em>and <em>B. terrestris</em>, with the later finally replacing both other species, as has been reported for Challhuaco Valley, in Argentina (Morales <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the IX Region, <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was recorded only twice in a recent survey on blueberry orchards, being very scarce in agricultural areas, and slightly more abundant in cordilleran areas with native forests. The whole area is largely dominated by <em>B. terrestris </em>and <em>B. ruderatus </em>(L. Vieli, pers. comm). In addition, in the Nahuelbuta National Park, where around 2006 <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was abundant, L. Packer (pers. comm.) did not observe any individuals in 2012-2013, in contrast seeing only <em>B. terrestris</em>.<br/><br/>In the X Region, in Chiloé Island a long-term survey since 2000 revealed that until 2008 this species was abundant, and declined after that, coinciding with the arrival on this island of the invasive <em>B. terrestris </em>(Smith-Ramirez, 2014). Similarly, in the XI Region, in Coyhaique <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was very abundant in the past. However, around 2008 this species began to decline and now <em>B. terrestris </em>is very abundant (Piere Barattini, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Finally, <em>B.dahlbomii </em>is one the few bee species in the XII Region (Magallanes) of Chile, and also present in Tierra del Fuego Island (Diaz Tavie <em>et al</em>. 2015 and references therein), where it has recently been recorded in Parque Karukinka, Tierra del Fuego (R. Muza, pers. comm). This species was still very abundant near Punta Arenas, Chile until 2013 (Leah Dudley, pers. comm., Díaz Tavie <em>et al</em>. 2015), and the XII Region was considered to host the only populations of <em>B. dahlbomii </em>still not overlapping with the invasive species <em>B. terrestris </em>(J. Montalva, pers. obs., see also Fig. 2 in Schmid-Hempel <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>However, since the recent naturalization of <em>B. terrestris </em>in the XII Region of Chile around 2012 (see the <em>Threats</em> section) a rapid and constant decline in the population of <em>B. dahlbomii </em>has been observed (Diaz Tavie, pers. comm. 2016). By the late summer and early fall of 2016, <em>B. terrestris </em>was more abundant than <em>B. dahlbomii </em>in Punta Arenas ,where T. Salazar (pers. obs.) only saw a handful (~5) of <em>B. dahlbomii </em>individuals during the months of March, April, and May 2016. Moreover, <em>B. dahlbomii </em>was not observed on a full-day trip in Parque Nacional Torres del Paine in February 2016, but a handful of <em>B. terrestris </em>workers were recorded (Morales, pers. obs).<br/><br/>The citizen science campaign “Salvemos Nuestro Abejorro” (<a href=""http://salvemosnuestroabejorro.wordpress.com"">http://salvemosnuestroabejorro.wordpress.com</a>) was established to encourage volunteers to submit photographic records of this species. It has been instrumental in proving that this species is still extant throughout most of its range, despite a severe reduction in relative abundance. However, the many independently published peer-reviewed studies, photographic records and personal observations summarized here point to a substantial decline in <em>B. dahlbomii </em>abundance and range, as well as local extirpations throughout Argentina and Chile in some sites where it was formerly common.",Decreasing,"<em>Bombus dahlbomii</em> is distributed in the southern tip of South America, which comprises two countries: Argentina and Chile, (Abrahamovich and Diaz 2001, Montalva <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Argentina, this species has been recorded in the following provinces (subcountry units, from North to South): Mendoza, Buenos Aires, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz (Abrahamovich and Diaz 2001). More recently it has been recorded for first time in Tierra del Fuego Province (J. Montalva, pers. comm). In Chile, <em>B. dahlbomii</em> has been recorded in the following regions (subcountry units, from North to South): IV (Coquimbo), V (Valparaíso), Metropolitan Region, VI (OHiggins), VII (Maule), VIII (BíoBío), IX (La Araucanía, including Mocha Island), X (Los Lagos, including Chiloé Island), XI (Aisén) and XII (Magallanes, including the Chilean portion of Tierra del Fuego Island), (Ruiz 1936, Toro and Chiapa 1997, Montalva <em>et al</em>. 2011, Díaz Tavie <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The northern limit of the species’ geographic range is located in the IV Region of Chile (Ruiz 1936). In Argentina, the northern historic limit lies in Mendoza Province (Abrahamovich and Diaz 2001). However, the occurrence of the species in Mendoza is based on a single recorded queen (collection date unknown, deposited at La Plata Museum Argentina—hereafter MLP—and published &gt;15 years ago), and bumblebee surveys in this province (Schmid-Hempel <em>et al</em>. 2014) have failed to find this species. Moreover, consulted pollination ecologists and bee biologists who have worked intensively in the field during the last 13 years never recorded this species in this Province (N. Chacoff, G. Debandi, J.P. Torretta, D. Medan, and D.Vazquez pers. comm). Thus, an eventual subpopulation surveyed in the past in Mendoza may be probably extinct, and the current northern limit in Argentina is the Province of Neuquén.<br/><br/>Although the easternmost specimens have been collected near the Atlantic coast in the Argentinian Province of Buenos Aires (Abrahamovich and Diaz 2001), its presence in this province is based on only two workers collected in 1977 (deposited at the at the La Plata Museum MLP). Bumblebee surveys in this province (Plischuck <em>et al</em>. 2009) have not reported this species. Consulted pollination ecologists and bee biologists working intensively in the field in the last 23 years have never seen this species in the province of Buenos Aires (J.P. Torretta, D. Medan, pers. comm). Thus, subpopulations surveyed in the past in this province may be possibly extinct.<br/><br/>The scarcity of records north from the Rio Colorado in Argentina, suggests that this river may be the natural northern limit of distribution of the species in Argentina, and&#160; that&#160; the few records in Buenos Aires and Mendoza may have resulted from small and isolated subpopulations in microhabitats suitable for this species (Abrahamovich <em>et al</em>. 2007). Furthermore, the few records at the Atlantic coast of the Patagonian region (only seven specimens in four localities of the provinces of Rio Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz, collected prior to 1981), and the lack of records in the Patagonian arid steppe, suggest that this species is associated with forest and humid habitats, more typical of the Patagonian Andes of SW Argentina.<br/><br/>This species reaches the Pacific coast along all the Chilean regions (IV-XII) where it has been recorded. The global western limit of <em>B. dahlbomii </em>is in the Pacific Ocean Islands (Chiloé Island) in the X Chilean Region.Thus, the distribution of <em>B. dahlbomii </em>extends westwards beyond the continental limit of South America.<br/><br/>The southern limit of this species’ geographical range&#160; is located in the Navarino Island, <em>ca</em>. 55°S (a small islet in the Beagle Channel south of Tierra del Fuego Island), in the Chilean XII Region, (queen deposited at&#160; the American Museum of Natural History, AMNH_BEE00147245; Isla Navarino, Chile; Septiembre 1935; J. Bird). It is noteworthy that this location is the global southernmost limit of the <em>Bombus </em>genus.<br/><br/>Finally, the report of this species' presence in Peru by Peat <em>et al</em>. (2005) seems to be the result of a misidentification of the species or the site of collection being incorrectly labelled. Paul Williams (pers. comm.) suggested that queens of <em>B. rubicundus </em>recorded in the High Andes of Peru might pose a misidentification with <em>B. dahlbomii</em>. No additional pinned specimens were found in the Museum of Natural History, London (MNHL), nor any specimen labelled as collected from Peru (Mr. David Notton pers. comm). Rasmussen (2003) did not include <em>B. dahlbomii </em>in a key for identifying bumblebee species of Peru either. Therefore, we can discard Peru as a country of occurrence of <em>B. dahlbomii </em>and therefore uncertain data from Peru has been excluded for this assessment. Finally, this species has been reported as mislabelled specimens from Panama by Milliron 1973a:165, and wrongly reported from Santos, Brazil by Handlirsch (1888:236), both quoted by Abrahamovich and Diaz (2002).<br/><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>","<p>This species has been experimentally reared in Chile for a couple of decades (Estay <em>et al.</em> 2001, Olavarria Morales 2003), after which the rearing methodology has been recently patented by the Ing. Patricia Estay, head of the Entomology Laboratory of &#160;the National Institute of Agronomic and Food research of Chile (INIA, La Platina), (<a href=""http://www.inia.cl/blog/2014/09/01/inapi-otorgo-patente-a-invencion-inia-para-domesticacion-y-crianza-de-abejorros-para-polinizacion/"">http://www.inia.cl/blog/2014/09/01/inapi-otorgo-patente-a-invencion-inia-para-domesticacion-y-crianza-de-abejorros-para-polinizacion/</a>). However it is uncertain whether hives of this species are being commercially produced or subject to trade.</p>",Terrestrial,"Many of the remaining Argentinian subpopulations as well as many of the Chilean subpopulations are located in National Parks and other Natural and Wildlife Reserves. However, if invasion of introduced bumblebees are the main drivers of its decline, solely protecting habitat will probably not be effective enough to revert this declining trend, because these invasive species also thrive in these habitats.<br/><br/>In addition there have been a lot of outreach activities (radio interviews, talks, etc.) and publications (Morales 2006a,b, 2007, 2009; Arbetman and Morales 2014) aimed to enhance the public awareness on this species.<br/><br/>In Argentina an educational brochure ""El mangangá y la polinización de nuestrosbosques"" has been designed by Carolina L. Morales and published with the support of the Cannon National Parks Science Scholar Program, the National Parks Administration of Argentina and the Universidad Nacional del Comahue.<br/><br/>In Chile a targeted campaign called ""Salvenos Nuestro Abejorro"" (Save our bumblebee) has been launched by Jose Montalva: <a href=""https://salvemosnuestroabejorro.wordpress.com/"">https://salvemosnuestroabejorro.wordpress.com/</a>. In addition, a proposal to classify and protect this species under the National Red Listing Scheme in Chile has been recently approved by the Ministry of Environment of Chile (<a href=""http://www.mma.gob.cl/clasificacionespecies/listado_especies_12o_pac.htm"">http://www.mma.gob.cl/clasificacionespecies/listado_especies_12o_pac.htm</a>). The final resolution will be officially published during 2016, and this classification is expected to trigger practical conservations measures.<br/><br/>Some proposed realistic actions needed to mitigate major threats to the taxon are to stop the ongoing importation of <em>B. terrestris</em>, control and eradicate the currently established populations of <em>B. terrestris</em> and <em>B. ruderatus</em> in areas where subpopulations of <em>B. dahlbomii </em>are still healthy (manual removal of colonies/mated queens), identify subpopulations of <em>B. dahlbomii</em> which are immune or resistant to pathogenic diseases that can be used for captive breeding and reintroduction programs, study rearing techniques specific to the native species, genetic analysis of populations where still abundant, to inform management programs. A possible action to reduce populations of invasive <em>Bombus </em>spp. might be to release sterilized drones or males to reduce the fecundity of the species as has been successful in other taxa.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
